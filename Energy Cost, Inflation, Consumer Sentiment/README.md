### Consumer Sentiment levers - Is inflation the true culprit of United States fear for the economy?


ðŸŽ“ Practicum I:
   - This practicum is to determine if inflation in the United States is a driving factor of the consumer sentiment drop in recent months. By reviewing monthly data going back as far as 2001 I was able to gain insights into what is a driving force of consumer sentiment in the United States using both multiple regresssion, two-way anova, and predictions in random forest regression.

### Hello, welcome to the Github page of Stan Evans!  üëã

  I am in the final stretches of completing my Ms in Data Science at Regis University. Currently I am learning all things data science but I put a big focus on: ETL, Data Engineering, BI, Visualization and the creation of tools for decision science. In previous life I was a sales leader in telecommunications. Currently, I am a data scientist at Xcel Energy automating services for analysts throughout the company and improving prediction models for wind farms! I love listening to what drives business decisions for different departments, translating this into workable business intelligence, and identifying opportunities in the customer journey, internal business cycle, and wherever my our teams pain points may be.

üéì Projects for Practicum:
   - The En Route project is at the permission of Alchemy 113. Tasked with buidling a dashboard of metrics at the direction of Brannan Johnson.
        - Cleaning, wrangling, and exploratory analysis
        - Creation of dashboard and KPIs for En Route
__"The enroute system is a real-time, GPS driven, fully integrated mapping logistics solution designed to maximize
employee productivity, improve customer service, and optimize your order flow. Enroute is an automated and integrated ‚Äútraffic control center‚Äù that
creates optimized routes that we call "Loops" on an interactive map, and then dispatches them to your drivers‚Äô smart phones.__

__The system was designed based on observing what was and was not working for our store clients, and building the system in a way to not replace, but augment their capability. Our solution will give you visibility of your drivers, and enable your ATC (traffic controller) to better plan the day, while increasing employee accountability and customer satisfaction."__ *https://www.alchemy113.com/enroute.html*

   - Molly's Liquors is one of the largest liquor retailers in the State of Colorado. Dedicated to the use of technology is their business, Molly's Liquors was a easy choice for me to partner with in my quest to democratize data science. I wish for small businesses to harness the power of decision science and leverage the information they create on a daily basis. 
        - TThe goal for Molly's was to explore the Reward Members program. It is difficult to understand undocumented customers. However, with the breadth of information they have in their rewards program we can discerne the types of cutomers by frequency and buying power. I aimed to determine lifetime value of a customer and to answer some of the questions they asked for me to uncover within the Point of Sale system, mPower.

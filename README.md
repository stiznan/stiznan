### Hello, welcome to the Github page of Stan Evans!  ðŸ‘‹

  I am in the final stretches of completing my Ms in Data Science at Regis University. Currently I am learning all things data science but I put a big focus on: ETL, Data Engineering, BI, Visualization and the creation of tools for decision science. In previous life I was a sales leader in telecommunications. I love listening to what drives business decisions for different departments, translating this into workable business intelligence, and identifying opportunities in the customer journey, internal business cycle, and wherever my our teams pain points may be. 
  
ðŸŽ“ This portfolio is continually being updated! So please check back for more updates as I continue my data journey! ðŸŽ“

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...anything IoT or customer journey related. I also love cleaning data and the process of analysis between database systems.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: vertical farming, optimization of resources, and where you like to ski! Bonus points if you are a fellow sneakerhead!

âš¡ Fun fact: Formerly an enterprise sales lead who loved building networks and connecting systems. I wanted to apply statistical methods to business problems and process improvements. Fast forward to 2021 and I am completing my Master's of Data Science! I love the community, decision science, and the enablement of my curiosity to drive business value and create efficient systems for the betterment of society! A massive supporter of smart agriculture and the IoT environments fostered. My goal is to be further involved in IoT for many different industries and using data analysis to create more efficient opportunities and business value.

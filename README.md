### Hello, welcome to the Github page of Stan Evans!  ðŸ‘‹

  I am in the final stretches of completing my Ms in Data Science at Regis University. Currently I am learning all things data science but I put a big focus on: ETL, ML, Data Engineering, BI, Visualization and more. And by 'more' this means the constant learning that this line of work requires. In previous life I was a sales leader in telecommunications. I love listening to what drives business decisions for different departments, translating this into workable business intelligence and identifying opportunities in the customer journey, internal business cycle, and wherever my curiosity leads. 
  
  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...anything IoT or customer journey related. I also love cleaning data and the process of analysis between multiple POS systems.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: vertical farming, optimization of resources, and where you like to ski! Bonus points if you are a fellow sneakerhead!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Formerly an enterprise sales lead who loved building networks and connecting systems, I dropped it all to pursue data science ultimately. I love the community, decision science, and the enablement of my curiosity to drive business value and create efficient systems for the betterment of society! Huge supporter of smart agriculture and the IoT enviroments fostered. My goal is to be further involved in IoT for many different industries and using the data analysis to create more efficient opportunities and business value.

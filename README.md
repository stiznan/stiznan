### Hello, welcome to the Github page of Stan Evans!  ðŸ‘‹

  I am in the final stretches of completing my Ms in Data Science at Regis University. Currently I am learning all things data science but I put a big focus on: ETL, ML, Data Engineering, BI, Visualization and more. And by 'more' this means the constant learning that this line of work requires. Huge supporter of smart agriculture and the IoT enviroments fostered. My goal is to be further involved in IoT for many different industries and using the data analysis to create more efficient opportunities and business value.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...anything IoT, I also love cleaning data and the process of analysis between multiple systems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... learning more and more about the power of python! Getting more time with hands on the keyboard.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... vertical farming, optimization of resources, and where you like to ski!
